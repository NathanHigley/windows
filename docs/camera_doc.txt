The bench camera's current IP is 10.183.100.11. Camera configuration may be accessed from this address.
The server host is based on 10.183.100.1, with FTP on port 21.
The camera is configured to FTP push an image capture every second, on a schedule between 8:00 to 14:30.

Should you no longer be able to connect or login to the camera, you will need to reset it with these steps.
    Disconnect the power supply.
    Press and hold the reset button.
    Keep holding the reset button and restore the power supply.
    Continue to hold the reset button for a further 10 seconds.
    Release the button and allow the camera to complete a restart/reboot.
    
You may wish to accompany this setup with a secondary client that automatically logins to the FTP server and pulls/sorts these images accordingly.
Just as well, you may wish to have the FTP Server set to delete its files once this is done, as the volume of images takes considerable space.
