Installing Cygwin | Using Cygwin with Powershell

1.] Install Cygwin: https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
    
    Use default installation settings. [Recommended Pacakge Download Site: http://cygwin.osuosl.org]

    Install the latest stable version of the following packages:
        (Change to 32bit package variations if needed)
        cygwin32-gcc-g++
        gcc-g++
        mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++
        mingw64-x86_64-libsigc++2.0
        (Feel free to install nano or vim, if desired)

    Reboot.

2.] Test Cygwin

    Run the Cygwin terminal. Enter "c++" and "g++". (The error should be something to do with lack of further input.)

    Feel free to create and compile a .cpp file to ensure it is working entirely.

3.] Integrate into Powershell

    Find your way to the Environment Variables. (Windows search should work.)

    Edit the User's PATH(or Path) Variable.
        Add a "New" line, which points to your Cygwin binaries directory. 
        (Default: C:\cygwin64\bin)

    Reboot.

    Powershell should now use any packages/commands used by Cygwin. (This means any package you add to Cygwin will also be available to execute in Powershell.)
